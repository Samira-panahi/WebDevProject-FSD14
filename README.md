**Welcome to EventHub** 
Your one-stop platform for discovering and booking events.

**What is EventHub?**
A website for event organizers to publish new events and build awareness and a list of potential participants for their events; and for users to discover new events they would like to go to.

**Getting started**
Before being able to test the website:
1. Create database using script in the app/database forlder called event_booking.sql.
2. Populate the database with data from seed.sql which can also be found in app/database.
3. Update config.php file in app/config file.
NOTE: photos for events may not show but can be found in public/uploads/event folder.

**User Features**
When logged in as a user (email: john.smith@example.com, passowrd: password123)
- View events and RSVP for an event (with login only).
- View and manage profile (with login only). Can update all the information and also change profile photo from default to another photo.
- create and edit our own events (with login only).

When logged in as an admin (email: admin@example.com, passowrd: password123)
- Access to all the same features as a regular user.
- Can edit/delete user profiles.
- Can edit/delete events.
- Can view/cancel rsvpâ€™s.

When not logged in you can still view events on homepage and use search bar to search event list, but will redirect to login page if you try to RSVP or create an event.

Have a great day!
